			<h1 class="heading-1">Welcome to <em><b>Eternal Techie's</b></em></h1>
			<p>I've seen a Lot of Tutorials based on Html, CSS, JS. But none of them are <em><b>FUN</b></em>. And are not Project-Based but are Concept Based. Which I don't like nor you(If you do like Go watch Them). That is why I want to Provide you some Project-Based Fun Projects. And you're in capable Hands Because This website has been Styled and Structured by me. Of Course your's Color Tastes might be Different. And the best part is that these Tutorials are Free. And One more thing you are not going to have Video Tutorials. Because I'm waiting for a Good Response on this Website. So do Motivate me by Sending a Mail to this Address: <em>tejasunderscore245@gmail.com</em>. And I'm looking for a Hundred Mails Guys so do Mail me. And If you don't see anything after going to the given link, Well Then wait for me to Construct the Tutorials</p>
